# 🧮 CPU Scheduling Simulator (GUI Project)

This project is a **Java-based Operating Systems simulation** that provides a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** to demonstrate how various **CPU Scheduling Algorithms** work in real time.

---

## 💡 Project Idea

The project aims to design and implement a **graphical user interface (GUI)** to simulate process scheduling algorithms used in operating systems.  

It supports the following scheduling algorithms:

1. **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)**  
2. **SJF (Shortest Job First)**  
3. **Priority (Non-preemptive)**  
4. **Round Robin (RR)**

## 🧠 Overview

CPU Scheduling is a core concept in operating systems, determining the order in which processes are executed by the CPU.  
This simulator helps visualize how different algorithms affect process execution, waiting time, and turnaround time.
